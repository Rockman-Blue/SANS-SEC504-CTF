# SANS-SEC504-CTF

My write-up for the Capture the Flag Event in the SANS SEC504 (Hacker Tools, Techniques, and Incident Handling) course. For more information, please see the "Capture-the-Flag Event" section of https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/hacker-techniques-incident-handling/

In this CTF, I am consulting for ISS Playlist. This is a fictitious company that has recently been compromised, and in the CTF the player is called upon to help them understand their exposure, as well as the hacker tools and tehcniques used to breach their network. In this CTF I applied the skills I learned in the SANS SEC504 course to use the same tactics used by attackers. This is in an effort to compromise modern, sophisticated networks. I worked independently to scan, exploit, and complete post-exploitation goals against various target systems. These target systems include Windows, Linux, IoT devices, and cloud targets. Through this hands-on challenge, I practiced and reinforced the concepts learned throughout the SEC504 course. This event taught me the steps to compromise target systems, pivot to internal hosts, and exfiltrate data. 

Topics Covered Include: 
* Target Discovery and Enumeration
* Applying Open-Source Intelligence and Reconnaissance Information-Gathering
* Public-Facing Asset Compromise
* Email Compromise
* Attacking Windows Active Directory
* Password Spray, Guessing, and Credential Stuffing Attacks
* Post-Exploitation Pivoting and Lateral Movement
* Choosing, Configuring, and Delivering Exploits
* Internal Attacker Compromise Attribution

As you can see from the screenshot below, I have completed every challenge. Each section/challenge category of this CTF will have their own folders, and each folder will have a file for each individual challenge within the category. Each challenge category starts with a "Stand-up Meeting" where you get information about the target system(s) for that challenge by the employees of ISS Playlist.
